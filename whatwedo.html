                    Ghana Make A Difference operates almost entirely with volunteer service, and it provides no compensation to its officers and directors. Because certain donors have elected to cover all administrative costs, 100% of financial contributions go directly to feed, clothe and care for these children in Ghana. Ghana Make A Difference is a registered 501(c)(3) organization; your contributions are tax deductible (Our tax I.D. number is 45-5615778).
