                <h2>We believe</h2>
                    <p>that children have been endowed by their creator with the inalienable right to be reared in a family. Thats why we make a difference in the lives of Ghanaian children by providing them with a place they can call home: a temporary home that includes food, shelter and physical, mental and emotional nurturing while trying to reintegrate them with their biological family or find them a new adoptive family.</p>
                <h2>our mission</h2>
                    <p>Our mission is to provide every child on this earth with an opportunity to gain knowledge about the world, power to act in it, and desire to be self-reliant and compassionate.</p>
                <h2>guilding benefit</h2>
                    <p>The Creator gave each of us life on this Earth so that we could learn to live happily, as He does. Our capacity for happiness increases with our capacity to love. Our capacity to love increases as we learn to see things as they really are, and as we acquire the power to act accordingly. Gaining vision and power is the heart of education.</p>
